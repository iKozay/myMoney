# penny.oink

Considering the recent inflation, and the ongoing recession, it's more important than ever to keep our pockets and our wallets full. That is exactly what penny.oink is designed to do.

## Features

* Track, view and modify your transactions
* Design your personalized budget and see how you compare in real-time
* Visualize your spendings with a selection of graphs

## Technologies Used

* For a finance management application, we figured that a mobile application would be the most practical. We decided to use Flutter to design our app.
* For our UI, we also made use of Figma.

## Challenges

Initially, we wanted to import purchase history from Apple Pay / Google Pay into the app to facilitate expense tracking and remove the need to enter data manually. However, we found that there are no APIs that allow this because of cybersecurity concerns. If ever such a feature becomes possible, we think it would be a great addition to our application.
